# CybergardenApp
Companion app for the Cybergarden system developed using Android Studio. The GUI is complete for the most part, but currently its only function is retrieving moisture values from
sensors connected to each plant.

Use Android Studio to open the project and view the source code and run the app. Before opening the project make sure to go to file -> settings -> system settings -> android SDK and install android 10.0 along with 11.0. Both versions must be installed for the app to be emulated.
